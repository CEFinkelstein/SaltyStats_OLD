About
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SaltyStats is a stat tracker for Salty Bet. It records win/loss records of
characters and displays the stats of a fight's combatants.

SaltyStats works by reading Salty Bet's Twitch chat. Specifically, it pays
attention to messages from the bot Waifu4u. The bot sends messages about
fights, and SaltyStats records this data locally.

SaltyStats connects to Twitch chat via IRC. You need to specify your username
and OAuth token in config.cfg in order to use SaltyStats. If config.cfg is
missing, SaltyStats will create it for you.

SaltyStats does not come with any stats and it will not bet for you. It is a
tool that makes stat tracking easier, not a betting bot. SaltyStats only
displays information that you have recorded, meaning that its records become
more reliable the longer you use it.


Use
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SaltyStats requires Python to work; it was designed using version 2.7. You can
download Python from python.org.

After configuring SaltyStats, you can launch it by running saltystats.py.
Information about how to configure SaltyStats is available below.

Setup
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SaltyStats must be properly configured before you can use it. There should be
a file named "config.cfg" in your SaltyStats directory. If your config.cfg is
missing, you can try running SaltyStats to create a new one.

Below is some information about each setting in config.cfg...

- username: Your Twitch username. SaltyStats needs this to connect to Salty
  Bet's IRC channel.

- oauth: For security reasons, Twitch does not allow you to connect to an IRC
  channel using your Twitch password. Twitch IRC uses OAuth tokens instead. An
  OAuth token looks like "oauth:asdasd234asd234ad234asds23". You can generate
  an OAuth token by going to http://twitchapps.com/tmi/.

- statfile: The location of the file SaltyStats saves records to. By default,
  this is stats.p in your SaltyStats directory. It doesn't have to be in the
  same directory as SaltyStats, though. You could store your statfile in
  another folder as long as you provide the complete path to it in config.cfg.
